Phase 1: Asynchronous REST Collector (Complete ‚úÖ)


Key Technologies

The core of this engine is built on:

1)Python 3.8+ (Programming Language)

2)asyncio (Asynchronous I/O Framework)

3)aiohttp (Asynchronous HTTP)


This phase established the foundation for high-speed market data retrieval using Python's asyncio and aiohttp.


Key Features Implemented:

1)High Concurrency: Achieved fast, concurrent fetching for multiple assets via the Binance REST API.

2)Data Normalization: Standardized output to JSON Lines (.jsonl), including asset identifiers and unified k-line fields.

3)Performance Validation: Verified time efficiency proving the benefit of the asynchronous design.
